# TIMER A Blink
Timer interrupts use a clock and a register to count to a certian value, and trigger an interrupt whenever the clock hits an interrupt value.  This is good for many applications.  One of these applications is a software "sleep()" function.  Rather than executing a for loop a certian number of times untill enought time has passed, this allows the processor to save processing power, and give the oppertunity to do multiple things at once.  For instance, if you were cooking a pizza, you would set a timer on the oven, then walk away and do other activities until the timer goes off.  Or you could take a nap untill you wake up by the timer.  The same applications apply here to the processor.  

This program utilizes the timer interrupt to make two LEDS flash at different rates, and sleep while it is not changing the LED's state.
