# Button Based Delay
This program uses interrupts for a timer and an LED. The processor sleeps, flips an LED, then sleeps again.  This happens at a frequency of 10Hz.  This program also allows for a programmable frequency.  The durration of the button being held down is the amount of time between future LED blinks.  This does so by setting a counter every 10th of a second in the timer module.  The timer always interrupts every 0.1 seconds.  If the frequency is less than 10Hz (fewer times per second), then the function increments a counter, and returns.  This happens until the counter is the right durration, then it resets, and flips an LED.
